4. *Play type distribution is balanced*, showing diverse strategies by teams.  
5. *Yards after catch* demonstrate strong contributions from receivers across all teams.  

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
NFL game data highlights a balance between *passing and running, but **passing plays remain the most decisive factor in touchdowns and yardage gains*. Short passes offer reliability, deep passes provide explosive moments, and score volatility is highest early in games.
